# ‚öñÔ∏è The Other Side

## üéØ Breaking the Echo Chamber
Our mission is to present people with a place to test the validity of their beliefs and expose themselves to new ideas from reliable sources advocating for all sides of a topic. By leveraging advanced AI and a curated knowledge base, we aim to foster meaningful dialogue and deeper understanding across different viewpoints.

## üí° Overview
The Other Side is a website and Chrome extension that revolutionizes how people engage with online content and controversial topics. Using a specialized RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) model trained on peer-reviewed research papers and reputable sources, we provide users with:

- Real-time fact-checking and source verification
- Balanced perspectives on complex topics
- Access to academic research in digestible formats
- Interactive debate features with AI-powered moderation

Our platform helps break echo chambers by exposing users to well-researched, diverse viewpoints while maintaining high standards of intellectual rigor.

## ‚ú® Key Features
- **Interactive Debates**: Engage in educational discussions with real-time fact-checking and source verification
- **Webpage Analysis**: Challenge and verify information on any webpage with our Chrome extension
- **Source Library**: Access a comprehensive database of peer-reviewed research and credible sources
## üé® Design Philosophy
Our platform is built on three core principles:

1. **Transparency**: All data sources are openly available and verifiable
2. **Accessibility**: Complex topics are presented in understandable formats
3. **Neutrality**: Balanced presentation of different viewpoints with clear source attribution

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used
### Frontend
- **React 19**: Core framework for building our user interface
- **Framer Motion**: Advanced animations and transitions

### Backend
- **Flask**: Python-based REST API
- **MongoDB**: Document storage for user data and cached sources
- **Google OAuth**: Secure user authentication
- **GCP (Google Cloud Platform)**: Cloud infrastructure and scaling
- **Vertex AI**: Large language model deployment and RAG implementation

### AI/ML Stack
- **Custom RAG Pipeline**: Built with Vertex AI

## üéØ Future Enhancements
- **Improved Data Curation**: Disagreements on some topics may stem from deeper systemic divides (e.g. religion, ethnicity), there are less research papers, not only on the subject as a whole, but for each side as well.
- **Knowledge Base Expansion**: Add more topics and sources while maintaining quality standards
- **Open Source Model**: Release model weights and training pipeline for community verification
- **Multimodal Integration**: Support for images, videos, and audio in discussions
- **Community Features**: Peer review system for user contributions
- **API Access**: Public API for researchers and developers
